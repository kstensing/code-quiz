## Usage

This quiz is used to help prepare the user for future coding assessments as part of an interview process or self learning.  

You can click the start quiz button to begin the assessment.  You will be presented with a series of questions to answer, and you will be notified when the answer is incorrect.  There is a time limit which begins when you select the start button.  You will face a penalty when you answer a question incorrect as additional time will be subtracted from the clock.  Once the assessment is completed, you will be able to track your high score by providing your initials to be paired with the high score. You will know the quiz is over when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
